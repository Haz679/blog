These past 4 weeks, I undertook the Summer Studio, Cyber Security an Offensive mindset. The Studio method was proposed a means too incorporate intensive self-learning, collaboration and research to reach the 5 learning outcomes as indicated below. This studio focussed on developing the 'offensive' from the security perspective. It introduced students to the ins and outs of the security world especially its lack in modern systems which was exemplified by the inclusion of industry professionals from well renowned firms. These professionals shared valuable experience and knowledge on a variety of topics, which allowed students to broaden their horizens.

I decided to take the subject as I believed it was a means to st least achieve a core foundation in the security industry. Previously I've attended several seminars hosted by the Cyber Security Society which were a useful introduction, however at that stage, my understanding wasn't entirely set in stone. Luckily, having a background in networking helped a lot in enumeration as I was able to understand basic addressing and protocols. At the beginning of the Studio, we had to come up with a list of objectives that we wanted to achieve by the end of the studio. These objectives were to ensure the work we put in would evolve into something that could be taken away, whether you passed or not. Mine were the followng: 

- Clearer job path
- Portfolio for future employment
- In depth technical knowledge
- Improved research skills
- Insight from the CSEC members
- Enhanced time management

SLO 1 - Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem
Throughout the studio, we have had the opportunity

## Ethical hacking on stake holders

Ethical hacking is the means of penetrating into the network of an organisation for the purpose of exploiting vulnerabilities under the legal consent of the hiring organisation. This in essence provides the organisation with the peace of mind that their network will be less open to outside attackers that would exploit these same vulnerabilities for their own benefit as well as the embarrassment of the victim

The purpose of ethical hacking is to ensure that the assets and data that belong to stakeholders remain secure and out of reach of the prying eyes of the public

Hacking ‘ethically’ requires these so called hackers to act under a code that protects the organisation from any harm 

In a simple example, the code would read like this:

- Understand the characteristics of the of the company
- Determine the sensitivity and confidentiality of the information
- Communicate, be transparent
- Do not violate set limits
- Do not disclose information to third parties

Hence such a code provides peace of mind to the stakeholders themselves that any portion of the company they own or data that the company posesses, such as investments for Superannuation and banking to health records are protected by law.

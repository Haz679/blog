## Ethical hacking on stakeholders

Ethical hacking is the means of penetrating into the network of an organisation for the purpose of exploiting vulnerabilities under the legal consent of the hiring organisation. This in essence provides the organisation with the peace of mind that their network will be less open to outside attackers that would exploit these same vulnerabilities for their own benefit as well as the embarrassment of the victim

The purpose of ethical hacking is to ensure that the assets and data that belong to stakeholders remain secure and out of reach of the prying eyes of the public

Hacking ‘ethically’ requires these so called hackers to act under a code that protects the organisation from any harm 

In a simple example, the code would read like this:

- Understand the characteristics of the of the company
- Determine the sensitivity and confidentiality of the information
- Communicate, be transparent
- Do not violate set limits
- Do not disclose information to third parties

Hence such a code provides peace of mind to the stakeholders themselves that any portion of the company they own or data that the company posesses, such as investments for Superannuation and banking to health records are protected by law.

## Bug Bounties on stakeholders
Bug bounty allow security teams to earn a sum of money for a bug that is found in an organisation's website. This bounty encourages persistance and hard work in the search, futureproofing the company from future attacks. Such a program can be an issue as bugs may be disclosed to the public on purpose, exposing data and other sensitive information unbenownst to the componay and likewise to their stakeholders.

A bug bounty program will have a scope in place

A scope states the type of the bugs to be found and where the hacker can poke and probe. It will also include a respobsible disclosure statement as well as the reward for finding certain bugs. The responsible disclosure affects both the finders and security teams alike and prevents either party from misconduct such as giving away sensitive information or not acting to improve security when a bug has been found

## Test Web Apps under RDP
Web app hacking requires a plethora of knowldge with regards to how the web works, its protocols, the OSI model and the respective tools that are used to break in. Under a respoonsible disclosure program, the exloits that are unveiled and broken using such tools must not be distributed openly to the public so as to make the information a vector of attack in the future
